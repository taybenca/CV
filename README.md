###
 
A Software Engineer interested in front-end development.

Before Makers, I graduated in Nutrition Sciences and volunteered in a hospital specialising in treating AIDS. I came to London to learn English and worked making medicines during the pandemic.

At the same time, I spent my nights and weekends focused on starting e-commerce to sell cakes. I took some online marketing and branding courses. As a hobby, I was studying programming logic. When I realised I was already changing careers. 

I have been learning to use Ruby and JavaScript to write web applications at Makers Academy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpqo9LYWCCc"> In my last project</a> at Makers, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in React, a technology that I find fascinating for making our code more organised and flexible.
I like being a software engineer because I can practice my creativity and problem-solving ability.
Working as a team is essential to me as it is a constant way of teaching and learning.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a> ✨
 #### *Teamwork, Pair programming and Communication*
  
Working as a team is something I think is essential because we can always learn and teach. 
It's a valuable exchange for everyone involved. When I was an operator at ITH Pharma, the hospitals often asked for batches for inventories. We needed to work as a team for better efficiency, where we were responsible for checking each other out.

This was highly beneficial for Makers when working in teams to accomplish projects. Understanding each other's needs and difficulties was crucial to delivering the project we would like to present.

Pair programming was a skill I learnt at makers that helps participants understand each other and their learning needs. 
  
Thinking together about the same problem makes the solution come faster, as well as understanding the problem. I understand pair programming as a way to help others.

*My blog post about teamwork:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/teamwork-my-experience-at-makers-caf996feb0f5"> <b>TeamWork: my experience at Makers</b> </a>*

*My blog post about pair programming:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/pair-programming-why-should-we-pair-every-day-87ed7bd1754e"> <b>Pair programming: Why should we pair every day?</b> </a>*

  
#### *TDD: Test-driven development and attention to detail*
I developed attention to detail skills during my work at ITH Pharma, when I compounded drugs, and each excess or lack of millilitre of medicine could cause harm to the patient. 

This soft skill helped me at Makers when I started testing each function before writing it and thinking about my expected behaviour. I learnt how vital testing an application is. Changing the code when a test is ready is a much simpler task. Developers must test quality code before writing it, which is how I plan to work.

*My blog post about it:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/lets-code-but-first-tdd-7cec0c1e9e0e"> <b>Let’s code, but first… TDD</b> </a>*


#### *Quick learner*

I adapt easily to different scenarios, and I learn things quickly to develop my programming understanding. I am currently taking a course to learn React, HTML and CSS at <a href= "https://www.alura.com.br/"> Alura</a> to be able to apply them to projects that I already have and, in the future, in new projects. These are front-end skills that I take great pleasure in studying.

SQL and MongoDB were two database technologies I learnt during Makers. Storing user data from the projects created during the course was essential. When I worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servi%C3%A7o_Social_do_Com%C3%A9rcio"> Sesc </a>, I used Excel to evaluate nutritional data from more than 10,000 children in all Brazilian states to monitor the development of childhood obesity.

Since I decided to study programming, JavaScript has been the language I've always wanted to comprehend. In the beginning, it was pretty challenging. It still is. Whenever I discover something new, I realise that there are ten other things to know about that topic, we are constantly learning and using our brain like we never used it before, and that's what fascinates me about learning within programming.

*My blog post about SQL:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/creating-tables-into-a-database-postg-14a4ea5e6dca"> <b>Creating tables into a database (PostgreSQL)</b> </a>*

*My blog post about JavaScript:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/callback-function-84cdc16b5754"> <b>Callback Function</b> </a>*

#### *Emotional Intelligence*

I always put myself in the other's shoes to understand why they are talking or acting in a certain way. When I worked at the hospital, I saw many people with serious health problems and understood, listened and gave hope to those people. Sometimes it's something that can make all the difference for them. 

#### *Languages*
  
English (Fluent) - Portuguese (Native) - Spanish (Basic)

- <b>Dog Sitting</b>: I do love dogs, they are all cute! Last summer I took care of five dogs, an average of 6 days each. They make me more peaceful and happier!
- <b>Blogging</b>: I have been writing in journals since I was 12 years old, when I started writing about everything necessary that happened in my day. Today I have a physical journal in that I mainly write (with colourful pens) about my travels and paste some pictures and stickers. I use <a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino"> Medium </a> to write about my life at Makers, especially about something I found most challenging.
- <b>Meditation</b>: I do meditation every day for ten minutes after having my breakfast. It's part of my morning habit. Meditation helped me to be more focused on daily tasks.
- <b>Cooking</b>: I love trying new things, especially foods from different cultures. <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/"> Jamie Oliver </a> is an inspiration to me in the kitchen, and I make at least once a month one of his recipes from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/5-Ingredients-Quick-Easy-Food/dp/0718187725/ref=asc_df_0718187725/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310842649900&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5584775920870516665&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046008&hvtargid=pla-321978254288&psc=1&th=1&psc=1"> 5 Ingredients - Quick & Easy Food </a>. I also feel very inspired by MasterChef. 🥣
