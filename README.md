# Tayanne Bencardino

A Software Engineer student passionate about front-end web development. 

I have been learning how to use the command line and Ruby for the past four weeks at Makers Academy. 

My goal for the next three months is to be able to write a tested and reusable, clean code using JavaScript and TypeScript.
