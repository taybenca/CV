<h1><div align="center"> Tayanne Bencardino </div></h1>

<div align="center">
  
A Software Engineer interested in front-end development.
  
Before that, I graduated in Nutrition Sciences and volunteered in a hospital specialising in treating AIDS. I came to London to learn English and worked making medicines during the pandemic.
  
At the same time, I spent my nights and weekends focused on starting e-commerce to sell cakes. I took some online marketing and branding courses. As a hobby, I was studying programming logic. When I realised I was already changing careers.
  
I have been learning to use Ruby and JavaScript to write web applications at Makers Academy. In my last project at Makers, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge in React, a technology that I find fascinating for making our code more organised and flexible.
  
My goal for the next six months is to be able to write a tested and reusable, clean code to collaborate on significant projects.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>
  
#### *Teamwork and Communication*
  
Working as a team is something I think is essential because we can always learn and teach. 
It's a valuable exchange for everyone involved. When I was an operator at <a href="https://ithpharma.com/"> ITH </a>, the hospitals often asked for batches for inventories. We needed to work as a team for better efficiency, where we were responsible for checking each other out. 

At makers, it was not much different. Working as a team was something accomplished in some projects. Understanding each other's needs and difficulties was crucial to delivering the project we would like to present.
  
  
*My blog post about it:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/teamwork-my-experience-at-makers-caf996feb0f5"> <b>TeamWork: my experience at Makers</b> </a>*
  

#### *Pair programming* 
  
Pair programming was a skill I learned at makers that helps participants understand each other and their learning needs. 
  
Thinking together about the same problem makes the solution come faster, as well as understanding the problem. I understand pair programming as a way to help others.

*My blog post about it:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/pair-programming-why-should-we-pair-every-day-87ed7bd1754e"> <b>Pair programming: Why should we pair every day?</b> </a>*
  
  
#### *TDD: Test-driven development*

At Makers, I learned how vital testing an application is. Changing the code when a test is ready is a much simpler task. Developers must test quality code before writing it, which is how I plan to work.

*My blog post about it:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/lets-code-but-first-tdd-7cec0c1e9e0e"> <b>Let’s code, but first… TDD</b> </a>*


#### *React - HTML - CSS*

These are front-end skills that I take great pleasure in studying. I am currently taking a course on these three technologies at <a href= "https://www.alura.com.br/"> Alura</a> to be able to apply them to projects that I already have and, in the future, in new projects.

#### *SQL - MongoDB - Excel*

SQL and MongoDB were two database technologies I learned during Makers. Storing user data from the projects created during the course was essential. When I worked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servi%C3%A7o_Social_do_Com%C3%A9rcio"> Sesc </a>, I used Excel to evaluate nutritional data from more than 10,000 children in all Brazilian states to monitor the development of childhood obesity.


*My blog post about it:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/creating-tables-into-a-database-postg-14a4ea5e6dca"> <b>Creating tables into a database (PostgreSQL)</b> </a>*

#### *Command line - VSCode*

I used the command line during the Makers pre-course. It was a challenge because I started using Windows Powershell, which didn't work with some functions of creating folders through the terminal, for example. So I switched to AWS, which I didn't adapt much. Soon after, I downloaded the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), the terminal I used until today on my VS code.

*My blog post about it:<a href="https://medium.com/@tayannebencardino/the-magic-black-screen-command-line-c5a43ed412d4"> <b>The magic black screen: Command line</b> </a>*


#### *JavaScript - JEST*


Since I decided to study programming, JS has been the language I've always wanted to comprehend. In the beginning, it was pretty challenging. It still is. Whenever I discover something new, I realize that there are ten other things to know about that topic, we are constantly learning and using our brain like we never used it before, and that's what fascinates me about learning within programming.
